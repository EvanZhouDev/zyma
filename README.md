## FAQ

> I have a question!

### How do I contribute?

See our [contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

TL;DR: Submit a PR of something you think will be useful!

### Why the name?

The Chinese for "here?" (as in "are you here?") is 在吗, which can be romanized to "zaì mā" using [pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin). "Zai ma" (removing accents) can be re-written to the cooler-looking but phonetically equivalent "Zyma".
